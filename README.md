# test-4

Included in this repository is the test file, the scripts, and a "raw" file with the functions in individual cells for your own shenanigans. There is also a text file containing strings to test. 

The test file can be activated by entering "py.test" in a terminal.

The full script and raw files can be examined and activated by calling their respective functions with appropriate inputs. The user should enter a number as the first input field of the functions, and copy and paste the requisite lines from the text file (or any string of their own choosing) as the second input field.
